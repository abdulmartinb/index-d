        Standardised tests are assessments designed to measure a student's knowledge, skills, or abilities in a consistent and uniform manner.  Many undergraduate programs require one or more US standardized test scores as part of the application process .  They typically have a predetermined format, set of questions, and scoring criteria. These tests are often used to measure a person's abilities or knowledge. This objectivity is achieved through predefined criteria for scoring and evaluation. The specific admission test requirements and score expectations can vary significantly among universities, so it's crucial to check the admission pages of the institutions you're interested in to understand their specific criteria and whether they have any test-optional policies.</P>
        <p>The United States does not have a single national college entrance exam that is administered uniformly across the entire country. Instead, there are several standardized tests used for college admissions, and the choice of test often depends on individual colleges or universities. The lack of a single national college entrance exam in the U.S. means that students have some flexibility in choosing which test to take based on their strengths and the preferences of the colleges to which they are applying. </p>
        <p>Some colleges and universities have adopted test-optional or test-flexible policies, allowing students to choose whether or not to submit standardized test scores as part of their application. These policies aim to reduce the emphasis on standardized testing in admissions and consider other aspects of a student's application more heavily. The three  most widely recognized college entrance exams in the U.S. are:</p>
        <p><a href="./TOEFL/index.html" class="blue"><b>TOEFL</b></a>: Test of English as a Foreign Language is  a standardized test used to measure the English language proficiency of non-native English speakers. If English is not your native language, most U.S. colleges and universities will require that you take an English language exam as part of the application process. </p>
        <p><a href="./Act/index.html" class="blue"><b>ACT</b></a>: American College Testing is a standardized test used for college admissions in the United States. It assesses high school students' readiness for college and is often used by universities and colleges as part of their admissions process. The <b>ACT</b> measures students' knowledge and skills in English, mathematics, reading, and science. It also includes an optional writing section. Many colleges and universities in the United States accept <b>ACT </b>scores as part of their application requirements.</p>
        <p><a href="./Sat/index.html" class="blue"><b>SAT</b></a>:  Scholastic Assessment Test is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States. This test measures critical reading, writing, and mathematical abilities. The <b>SAT</b> is widely accepted at accredited two and four-year colleges and universities in the United States . </p>
