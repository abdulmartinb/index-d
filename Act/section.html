    <h3>The ACT test consists of four main sections, plus an optional writing section:</h3>
    <ul>
<li><b>English: </b>This section assesses your knowledge of English grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, and rhetorical skills. You'll answer questions related to passages and sentences.</li><br />
<li><b>Mathematics: </b>The mathematics section evaluates your mathematical skills in algebra, geometry, and some trigonometry. You'll solve math problems to demonstrate your quantitative abilities.</li><br />
<li><b>Reading:</b> In the reading section, you'll read several passages on various subjects and answer questions to test your comprehension, analysis, and interpretation skills.</li><br />
<li><b>Science: </b>The science section measures your ability to interpret and analyze scientific data, graphs, and research summaries. It focuses on scientific reasoning rather than specific content knowledge.</li><br />
<li><b>Optional Writing (Essay):</b> The writing section is optional but recommended by some colleges. If you choose to take it, you'll be given a prompt and asked to write an essay expressing your perspective on the issue presented. This section assesses your ability to generate and organize ideas, use evidence, and develop a coherent argument.
