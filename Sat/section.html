    <ul>
        <li><b>Evidence-Based Reading and Writing (EBRW): </b>This section includes two parts: Reading and Writing & Language. In Reading, you'll answer questions based on provided passages. In Writing & Language, you'll edit and improve sentences and paragraphs.</li>
    <br />
    <li><b>Math:</b> The Math section assesses your math skills, including algebra, geometry, and some trigonometry. You're allowed to use a calculator for part of this section.</li>
    <br />
    <li><b>Optional Essay:</b>  While it's no longer required by most schools, the essay section evaluates your ability to analyze and critique a provided text.</li>
